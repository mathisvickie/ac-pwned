# ac-pwned
I had some free time so I made a remake for my old AssaultCube cheat https://github.com/mathisvickie/ac-cheat

I rewrote entire code, updated everything to fit the new game version and also included disassembled locations of reversed interests. This should make updating offsets more easy. Fun fact: Everything I have done in just one day!

## Features
- Wallhack (see players and items thru walls)
- Aimbot (automatic humanized legit aiming with line tracing)
- Triggerbot (automatic fire on enemy when in sight)

## SS
